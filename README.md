# Nebula

&nbsp; Nebula is a fullstack web application created to be used as the company's internal forum. A lot of companies unfortunatly share a big problem the misinformation. <br>

&nbsp;It is common to see employees that can not do their work because of the lack of information. Sometimes this misinformation occurs because the company does not have enough employees to propragate information in the company. In other cases there are enough employees with the necessary knowledge, but they are too busy doing their own work. Another reason for this problem is the lacking of trainament.

&nbsp; Even tough there are several reasons that may lead to this situation.One simple solution would be a platform where the employees can ask questions and be replied for any other avalible employee in the company that is capable to do so. So that how nebula was born.
